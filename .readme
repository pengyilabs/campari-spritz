## Setting Up Environment Variables

### Important! 
Before deploying this application, you must create secure environment variables for the following:  

1. **Google Maps API Key**  
2. **Campari API URLs**  
   - Places API URL  
   - Subscription API URL  

These variables should be securely provided and accessed via a backend service to prevent exposing sensitive information in a public frontend application.  

### Why This Is Important

This application is purely frontend-based, and for testing purposes, it uses a **mock setup** for these environment variables. However, this approach is **insecure** because the values are exposed in the client-side code and can be accessed publicly.  

### Variables and Their Locations

You need to replace the following mock environment variables with your actual environment variables:  

- **`ENVIRONMENT.MAPS_API_KEY`**  
  - **File:** `index.js`  
  - **Line:** 16  

- **`ENVIRONMENT.CAMPARI_PLACES_URL`**  
  - **File:** `components/map.js`  
  - **Line:** 8  

- **`ENVIRONMENT.CAMPARI_SUBSCRIPTION_URL`**  
  - **File:** `components/voucherModal.js`  
  - **Line:** 141  

### Testing the Application Locally

For testing purposes, a mock environment configuration is included in the project.  

#### Steps to Test Locally:
1. Locate the file named `env.example.js` in the root of the project.  
2. Rename the file to `env.js`.  
3. Edit the file to include your API key and URLs in the corresponding variables.
