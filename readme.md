## Setting Up Environment Variables

### Important!

Before deploying this application, it's highly recommended to create secure environment variables for the following:

1. **Google Maps API Key**
2. **Campari API URLs**
   - Places API URL
   - Subscription API URL

These variables should be securely provided and accessed via a backend service to prevent exposing sensitive information in a public frontend application.

### Why This Is Important

This application is purely frontend-based, and for testing purposes, it uses a **mock setup** for these environment variables. However, this approach is **insecure** because the values are exposed in the client-side code and can be accessed publicly.

### Variables and Their Locations

You need to replace the following mock environment variables with your actual environment variables (Search for those variables with the searcher and simply replace the code):

- **`ENVIRONMENT.MAPS_API_KEY`**
- **`ENVIRONMENT.MAP_ID`**
- **`ENVIRONMENT.CAMPARI_PLACES_URL`**
- **`ENVIRONMENT.CAMPARI_SUBSCRIPTION_URL`**

### Testing the Application Locally

For testing purposes, or, in the case you desire to use the frontend system for var environment made with JS, you simply must to follow these steps:

#### Steps to Test Locally / Setup frontend variables:

1. Locate the file named `env.example.js` in the root of the project.
2. Rename the file to `env.js`.
3. Edit the file to include your API key and URLs in the corresponding variables.

### Map ID setup

This project requires setting up a Map ID. In case your Maps project does not have a Map ID set, you can follow this guide to create one https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/get-map-id
